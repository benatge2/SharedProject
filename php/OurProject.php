                <p>We are currently engaged in an internationalism project with an institute based in the Netherlands. The main goal of this project is to collaboratively create a website that showcases information about each other's country. Through this initiative, we aim to explore the possibilities and challenges of remote work and cooperation across borders. By designing and developing this website together, we seek to foster cultural exchange, promote mutual understanding, and evaluate the effectiveness of working remotely with a team located in a different country. This project not only allows us to share knowledge and perspectives but also highlights the significance of cross-cultural communication and collaboration in today's interconnected world.</p>
